At the end of March, through [ARC's TechSocial](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/techsocial-series) we run a Linux install party. 

That install party included a [short talk introducing Linux](https://hackmd.io/@dpshelio/ByFFzYlaJe#/) followed by the participants installing a flavour of Linux on their laptop (we provide pendrives with a large selection of options to choose from). All that, of course, with plenty of üçï pizza!

At the end of the event we discussed what to do next, and we agreed to have a website (here we've got it!) and a classic mailing list to start building the community!
